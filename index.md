Hi, my name is Aleksei Mikhalevich, I'm 18 y.o. and i'm a junior frontend developer. Let me introduce myself.
I was born and raised in Homyel.
In my childhood I really enjoyed chess and mathematics.
I participated in many tournament and olympiads and had success there
In high school i wasn't really into programming.
I took part in different Olympiads, like math, english, and have some minor accolades there, but i really found success in geography. 
I got 3rd degree diploma at the Republican Olympiad. But I didn't like my perspective in geography and I always wanted to try myself in IT sphere. 
So I passed all my exams, got into my desired speciality of "Information Technologies in Automated Systems" and now I'm Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics student.
The program is fine, but i wanted to get some useful knowledge to get a job and jump into this industry. So, now I'm taking RSSchool Frontend course. I really enjoy the program.
I'm getting very useful experience, that obviously will help me in my future career.
For example, in online-zoo we'll make real web-site, that students can use in their portfolios.
I can point math, English and my understanding of algorithms as my strengths.
I have basic knowledge of JavaScript and i'm looking to improve it. 
I want to get some more experience and information, that will improve my programing skills significantly.
Also I have knowledge in C++, because I study it in my university. My English is pretty decent, itâ€™s approximately on B2+ level.
Now, briefly about my soft skills. In high school I was student government chairman, so I have management skills and experience. I can deal with different people. 
I'm comunicative and easy-going.
So, that's all folks, thanks for watching!
